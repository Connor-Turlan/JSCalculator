### JavaScript Calculator

This is a simple project that includes both a simple and more advanced calculator.

The simple calculator uses functional programing and simple HTML forms to provide a basic interface.

The advanced calculator uses an object oriented model with a calculator object. It also provides slightly more functionality with x^2 and memory storage and management.
